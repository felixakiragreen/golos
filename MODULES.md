# Mental Modules

(Put these in a visual grid)

### Planned for v1.0 (01.jan.12021)

- Habit Tracker
  - Track & visualize your progress & consistency at maintaining certain habits over time.
  - Inspiration drawn from  Fitness.
- Time Blocker
  - A lower maintenance form of time tracking that doesn’t require logging in the moment or lots of categorizing usage logs.
  - Inspiration drawn from BlockyTime.
- Character Sheet
  - Visualize & track your own stats as a Character in a Role Playing game.
  - Inspiration drawn from D&D and every RPG. v1.0

Planned through out 12021
(I think I’ll be able to do a module every 2 weeks, that’s my goal at least)

- Planning
  - Write down your plan for your day, week, any time interval… with your own prompts. Your plan can include habits, projects, chores, anything from any other module. Or just “auto-plan” your day (sourced by other modules) and adjust as needed.
- Reflections
  - Reflect on how your day, or plans went. Or just use it to ask any prompts at any time.
- Life Timeline
  - Harness the Overview Effect by seeing the big picture: your whole life span. Inspiration drawn from WaitButWhy’s Life Calendar.
- Projects
  - Cognitive Bootstrap - Unlocking the potential
- Scratchpad

  - First, a place to write something down super quickly. Second, an automatic way to review & organize them.

- Chores
  - Track time since last time you did something, so you can know which chores most urgently need your attention.
- Tally
  - Keep track of how much or often you do things.
- Tasks

  - Yup. A todo list.

- Routines
- Day Visualizer
- Memories / Experiences

* Standards
  - Keep track of how well you do something over time.
* Dragons

  - For giant things you dread doing. Get help breaking them apart into manageable chunks and feel great about Slaying the Dragon when it’s all done. Tracks all the monsters you’ve slain.

* Ambitions
* Life Goals

* Pomodoro
* Awards
* Behavior Builder
  - “Atomic Habits”
* Progression System
  - Belts in jiujitsu
* Master Plan
  - Build your own Master Plan like Elon Musk and Martin Molin (from Wintergatan) and track how to progress towards it over years.

### Distant

### Ideating

- GraphDB backend
  - Connect to a Graph DB API (like Roam) to use it as a back-end for all your data, that way everything in your Operating System can be reused through “everything is graph”.
- Solid POD backend
- CSV, JSON export
  - Complete dump, or specific data for visualizations
- Public “Mental Module” Extension Interface
  - Enable community development for any mental module. For example: CRM (contacts management), I don’t need it but I know many do.
