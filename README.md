# The Game of Life Operating System

_To Visualize All of Life's Most Meaningful Data_

We don't know why the brain be like it do. 🧠

Were you ever assigned a book to read for homework that was like... the hardest thing ever to get through? Only to then rediscover how good it actually was years later? 🤯

Adulting responsibly is hard. It's like homework but all the time with no summers or end. ⚰️

Fuck that, now all I want to do is just play games. 👾

Well, there is one thing I enjoy more than playing games: making stuff. 🦾

But I really can only do it when I feel inspired. 🌅

And after too much adulting, the inspiration dies. 🕯

I've tried other people's systems & software. And some of it has helped quite a bit. I really like Fitness, Notes, Reminders, & Done. I kind of like Things 3, Notion, Obsidian, & Roam. But they're all work. 😓

Now I just want play games again. 🎮

AHA. I know what I need. 💡

I need a game that's addictively fun to play and as a side benefit also helps me organize my life. 🥳

That's what this is. 🤖

It's my Game of Life. 👽

If you're reading this before 12021.03.09 (March 9th of this year) then there isn't much to see yet. I will be releasing a video that tries to explain more of my vision for this. It's pretty grandiose, but I feel confident about it since I've been thinking about these things for most of my life. Deep down, I feel like it's what I'm meant to do. While it's starting off as something really just for my own use, I think it could help a lot of other kids that struggle with productivity software that is more akin to work than play. Also, who doesn't want to view their own life as an RPG? It's the ultimate one. You can do anything. You just need an interface that lets you see it as the game it really is.
